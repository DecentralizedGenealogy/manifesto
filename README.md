This document is a work in progress. The purpose is to articulate a set of ethical standards for the genealogy industry, and outline criteria for recoginizing those people, companies, and organizations who exemplify these standards.

FHISO was recently approached by one of its Founding Member organizations regarding 'Open Access'. The contact was disappointed that FHISO had not tried to get genealogy companies to be more open about their data. Simply ticking the GEDCOM box is not really sufficient these days (even if other products can read your version of it), but when it comes to databases and APIs then some of these companies do not document alternative means of access, and maybe only share such information under license.

FHISO is not really in a position to do this on its own, although it is certainly interested. Anyone who has read http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2017/11/thither-fhiso.html will know that FHISO's current strategy of 'component standards', and an updated GEDCOM that can make use of them, is intended to get companies to a more compatible level -- one that would make it easier for them to adopt newer technologies. This would eventually include APIs, although their focus isn't there yet.

In the meantime, one of the more practical suggestions that came from that discussion was the creation of a "kite mark", or other visible symbol, that could be displayed on Web sites and products to distinguish companies that met certain criteria regarding 'Open Access'. I believe that a very similar approach could be used for general ethics.
